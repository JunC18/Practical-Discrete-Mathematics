Write a Python function suggest_friends(graph, user) that takes in a graph representing social network and a specific user and return a list of suggested friends for that user. The graph is represented as an adjacency list, where the keys are user IDs, and the values are lists of user IDs that the key user follows. Use the given Q3.csv as the dataset."
